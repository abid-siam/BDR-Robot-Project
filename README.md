# Bomb Disarming Robot (BDR)
### Specifications
Design a robot using Lego Digital Designer as your primary design tool. Your team must build a model of your design using the materials provided. A Mindstorms program that will direct the robot's movements must be created. A cost estimate of the robot's components must be provided. All revisions to the original design must be recorded and explained. This includes technical design drawings, as well as cost estimates. All revisions to the Mindstorms program must be recorded and explained. The BDR must be able to move autonomously over a pre-selected route, disarm a bomb, avoiding any decoy bombs, and, for extra credit, disable and retrieve triangulation devices, returning them to the start point. The BDR must not touch the decoy bombs even after they disarm the bomb. The robot must fit in a start area that is 25cm by 25cm by 20cm high (see Figure 1). These specifications must be met for final commissioning. The robot program may not be altered or switched during any part of the mission. Likewise, the robot must be fully autonomous, and therefore cannot be touched by any person during testing. Please refer to the course syllabus for all due dates.
Route 1: The robot must follow the black line, traverse the black tunnel, disarm the bomb, and return to the start area.
Route 2: The robot must navigate the perimeter of the course, proceed to the bomb's location, disarm it, and return to the start area.
Please Note: Projectile (catapult, slingshot) designs are not allowed; your robot must travel to the bomb in order to disarm it.
### Microsoft Project
A time management plan using Microsoft Project (MS Project) must be created. You can learn Microsoft Project by doing the MS Project Skill Builder. This plan must include all tasks related to the project. The MS Project schedule should include the following:

**Minimum of 20 tasks.**
* Milestones should be clearly indicated on the project plan (duration of zero days).
* Each task must include the person responsible for completing the task (resource names).
* Use the Copy Picture function to include the project plan in the presentations. DO NOT take a screenshot.
* Gantt chart must be displayed alongside the tasks list (fit onto one slide).
* Gantt chart must clearly show a progress line.
* Clearly state during the presentation whether the project is on time, behind schedule or ahead of schedule

### Drawings
All drawings and sketches should be made using Lego Digital Designer.
Create four drawings of the robot: front, top, most detailed side, and a drawing of the gear trains. Sensors, motors, and gears must be included in each drawing. If the robot does not use any gears, make sure to explicitly state that during the presentations.
Each revision of the design must be documented and all changes must be presented during Milestone presentations.

### Cost Estimate
Once a robot design is complete, a cost estimate must be generated that specifies the cost of all the materials and labor required for the construction of the design. Tabulate this cost information clearly in an Excel spreadsheet, using the materials cost list provided. Help in calculating the cost is available by reviewing How to plan the schedule and calculate costs for a project. The costs for the parts can be found on the Price list for Lego parts for robot projects.

***Note***: You should only use the materials contained in the Price list for Lego parts for robot projects. If you want to use other parts, get permission from your faculty member to do so, and also to determine the cost of the parts you want to use that are not in this price list.

Create a cost estimate on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The cost estimate should include the following:
* Labor cost breakdown with hours and rates
* Consolidate low-cost pieces: axles, beams, bricks, bushings, connectors, gears, plates
* Itemize high-cost pieces: controllers (NXT/EV3), sensors
* No decimal places; this is an estimate after all. Round appropriately
* Total cost must be shown in the bottom right corner
